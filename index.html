            <h3>6G Technology: The Future of Connectivity</h3>
            <div class="justified-text">
                <p>6G technology represents the upcoming frontier in wireless networks, moving beyond the current 5G standards to provide speeds that could reach 1 terabit per second. This shift is not just about speed but about achieving near-zero latency, estimated at less than 0.1 milliseconds. Leading countries like China, South Korea, and the United States are currently in a race to define these standards, with organizations like the Next G Alliance and the 6Genesis project in Finland spearheading research.</p>
                
                <p>One of the most significant advantages for the future is the seamless integration of artificial intelligence within the network fabric. This will allow the network to self-optimize and support massive machine-type communications. Nations that dominate 6G patents will likely hold a strategic advantage in the global digital economy, as this technology will be the backbone of autonomous industries and smart cities.</p>
                
                <p>In my opinion, the most exciting application of 6G lies in the realm of immersive technologies. These ultra-fast connections will provide the necessary bandwidth for high-fidelity Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) without the lag that currently limits user experience. This will enable holographic communication and real-time digital twins, fundamentally changing how we interact with the digital and physical worlds.</p>
                
                <p>Furthermore, 6G aims to bridge the global digital divide by integrating terrestrial networks with non-terrestrial networks like low-earth orbit satellites. This will provide universal coverage, reaching remote areas where traditional infrastructure is unfeasible. For a computer engineering student, understanding this convergence is essential for designing the next generation of global systems.</p>

            <h3>SRv6: Simplifying Network Architecture</h3>
            <div class="justified-text">
                <p>Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) is a modern networking protocol that utilizes the IPv6 extension headers to source-route packets. This technology simplifies the network control plane by removing the need for traditional protocols like RSVP-TE or LDP. By encoding a list of segments directly into the IPv6 header, the network can define specific paths and processing instructions for each packet, enabling sophisticated traffic engineering at scale.</p>
                
                <p>The primary advantage of SRv6 is its ability to support network slicing and deterministic networking. This is particularly useful for service providers who need to guarantee specific latency and bandwidth for different types of traffic, such as industrial IoT or real-time gaming. Countries like China and Japan are leading the adoption, with major ISPs already deploying SRv6 to modernize their core infrastructures.</p>
                
                <p>However, centralizing path control within the IPv6 header raises significant security concerns. Entrusting a single protocol with the entire routing logic could create a single point of failure; if the SRv6 mechanism is compromised, the entire traffic flow could be vulnerable to redirection or interception. Given my experience in offensive security and pentesting tools, I believe that header manipulation and unauthorized segment insertion are risks that must be addressed before widespread deployment[cite: 21, 54, 10, 42].</p>
                
                <p>Despite these vulnerabilities, SRv6 is the natural evolution of MPLS for a cloud-native world. It provides better visibility and programmability, allowing engineers to manage traffic with the same agility as software. As I progress through my studies at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, I aim to explore how we can balance this high-efficiency routing with the robust security frameworks required for the networks of the future.</p>
